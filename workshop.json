  "Title": "Autoget Blacklist",
  "Description": "Tired of automatically grabbing unwanted items like sower's seeds and low level flaming/freezing swords just because you have 'Autoget Artifacts' turned on? With this mod you get menu item on any identified artifact to stop collecting it with Autoget!\n\nOnly shows up while you have Autoget Artifacts turned on, and does not show up for items eligible for 'Treat as Scrap' once you have the Disassemble skill.\r\n\nALSO: \n  * Food items can be blacklisted (when Autoget Food is turned on)\n  * Blacklisted food items will NOT be automatically harvested even when you have harvesting turned on\n  * Option setting available (default off) to broaden the \"treat as scrap\" categories (e.g. so ALL metal folding chairs, whether or not they have \"flaming\" or whatever). NOTE - if you switch this on mid-game, it doesn't remember your individual category settings, you will have to start your broader categories from scratch.\n\n1.1 - Added ammo to the things you can blacklist\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Cattlesquat/QudAutogetBlacklist.git",
